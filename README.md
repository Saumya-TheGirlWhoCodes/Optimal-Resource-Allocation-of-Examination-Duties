# Optimal-Resource-Allocation-of-Examination-Duties
Since faculties invigilate for a continuous duration of 3 hours during examination duties which is quite a tedious task. The current research is to study and develop algorithms that would replace the traditional system with the current framework which can provide an optimal solution to this problem. The main focus is to generate a tool which would help to allot 1 hour duty at a scheduled duration for the faculty members.

To provide an optimal resource allocation system for examination duties, where  a system will be created that will divide the stretch of 3 hours into 3 parts i.e. each part = 1 hour. 

We intend to design a priority-based tool with the help of C language, where we should be able to divide 3 hours of examination duty of the faculty into 3 modules. Each faculty would be assigned alternate duties, which would help in avoiding invigilation by an individual faculty for 3 hours continuously.
